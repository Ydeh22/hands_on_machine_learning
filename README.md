# Hands on Machine Learning course of Master in Photonics [UPC+UB+UAB+ICFO]

Set of Jupyter notebooks to teach and learn deep learning for physics and photonics.

## Instructions

You can run these tutorials either in **Your Own Laptop** or in **Google Colab** see sections below.

### · Use your own laptop

These tutorials are coded in Jupyter notebooks with Python language. 
Jupyter is included in the Anaconda set of programs, so we recommend downloading 
and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).

#### Extra dependencies

#### Run tutorials

Download the tutorials you want to run (any of those files ended with `.ipynb`)
by means of the `download link` on top of every notebook.
Probably, you should `[RightClick]+SaveAs` to download the content in a 
certain file. Make sure that it ends with `.ipynb`.

We recommend to work in a specific folder for all the tutorials.
You can get all files at once by cloning this GitHub repository
(for that, `git` should be installed on you computer).

Then, open Anaconda and launch the Jupyter Notebooks App from the Anaconda browser.
A webpage should be opened in your internet browser with a kind of files browser.
Go where the tutorials are and click on one of them. Now, the tutorial is opened 
in a new tab. You can **edit** (`[DoubleClick]` or `[Enter]`) and  **run** (`[Shift]+[Enter]`) 
any cell in the Notebook.

Check the 
[Jupyter Documentation](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html#notebook-user-interface)
for detailed information.


### · Use Google Colab

To run in Google Colab any tutorial on this repository, 
you just need to go to that specific tutorial and 
click on the `Run in Google Colab` link on top of the file.
That's it!

#### Pros:
- All is ready to run there from the beginning.
- You have one GPU (Tesla4) to get faster.

#### Cons: 
- You need a Google account to run it.
- Only one tutorial can run at once.
- You need internet connection.
