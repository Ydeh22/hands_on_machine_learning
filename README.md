Set of Jupyter notebooks to teach and learn deep learning for physics.

## Instructions

You can run these tutorials either in your own laptop or in Google Colab

### · Use your own laptop

These tutorials are coded in the Jupyter notebooks in Python lenguage. 
Jupyter is included in Anaconda programs, so we recommend to download 
and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).

#### Run tutorials

Download the tutorials you want to run (any of those files ended with `.ipynb`)
by means of the `download link` on top of every notbook.
Probably, you should copy all content and paste it to an empty file.
Name that new file as you want, but it must end as `.ipynb`.

We recommend to work in a specific folder for all the tutorials.
You can get all files at once by cloning this GitHub repository
(for that, `git` should be installed on you computer).

Then, open Anaconda and launch the Jupyter Notbooks App from the Anaconda browser.
A webpage should be opened in your internet browser with a kind of files browser.
Go where the tutorials are an click on one of them. Now, the tutorial is opened 
in a new tab. You can **edit** (`[DoubleClick]` or `[Enter]`) and  **run** (`[Shift]+[Enter]`) 
any cell in the Notebook.

Check the 
[Jupyter Documentation](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html#notebook-user-interface)
