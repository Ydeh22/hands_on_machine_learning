# Hands on Machine Learning course of Master in Photonics [UPC+UB+UAB+ICFO]

Set of Jupyter notebooks to teach and learn deep learning for physics and photonics.

## Installation insructions

You can run these tutorials either in **1. Your Own Laptop** or in **2. Google Colab**, see the two subsections below:

### · 1 Using your own laptop

These tutorials are coded in Jupyter notebooks with Python language. 
Jupyter is included in the Anaconda environment, so we recommend downloading 
and installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).

#### Dependencies

You can install the dependencies by running the
[00_install_dependencies.ipynb](00_install_dependencies.ipynb)
notebook. So, follow the next section below to run it as a demo, 
and then you will get ready for all tutorials.


#### Run tutorials

Download the tutorials from the 
[course web at UPC-Atenea](https://atenea.upc.edu/course/view.php?id=71605) intranet.

<ins>Alternativelly</ins> , you can download the file you want from this github repository
(those files on the list above ended with `.ipynb`)
by means of entering and click the `Download notebook` button on top of every file.
Probably, you should `[RightClick]+SaveAs` to download the content in a 
certain file. Make sure that it ends with `.ipynb`.

> Take into a count that if that file is not in the UPC_Atenea yet, 
it is probably not in its final version. Use only 'master' branch.

We recommend to work in a specific folder for all tutorials.

Then, open Anaconda and launch the Jupyter Notebooks App from the Anaconda Navigator.
A webpage should be opened in your internet browser with a kind of a files browser.
Go where the tutorials are located and click on one of them. Now, the tutorial should be opened 
in a new tab. You can **edit** (`[DoubleClick]` or `[Enter]`) and  **run** (`[Shift]+[Enter]`) 
any cell in the Notebook.

Check the 
[Jupyter Documentation](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html#notebook-user-interface)
for detailed information.


### · 2 Using Google Colab

To run any tutorial on this repository in Google Colab, 
you just need to go in to that specific tutorial and 
click on the `Run in Google Colab` button on top of the file.
That's it!

#### Google Colab Pros:
- All is ready to run there, from the very beginning.
- You have one GPU (usually a Tesla4) to get faster.

#### Google Colab Cons: 
- You need a Google account to run it.
- Only one tutorial can run at once.
- The code is not in your laptop, so you have to take care to save your changes.
- You need a quite stable internet connection.
